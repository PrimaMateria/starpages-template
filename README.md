# Startpages

Start pages are designed to replace the default browser's new tab page. So
every time you open a new tab, one of your start pages will be displayed,
showing you a list of your favorite links.

This is a template repository. You can create your own GitHub repository on
your own account using this template. Once created, you can edit the
configuration file (you can also use the GitHub web editor). For each link, you
can specify an icon and organize the links into categories and columns.

When you commit the changes, the already prepared GitHub action will parse your
configuration file and generate the GitHub pages, which you can then use to
override the browser's new tab location setting.
